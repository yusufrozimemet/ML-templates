Each decision tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of features. It aggregates the predictions from all trees to produce the final prediction. Random Forest Regression reduces overfitting, improves generalization, and provides better predictive performance compared to a single Decision Tree Regression.
